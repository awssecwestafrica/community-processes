# Publication Writers Policy
* Being a community publication writer offers community members an avenue to share their knowledge not only on technical content by societal and regional cloud/cloud security news that could benefit other community members
* To be added as a publication writer, please reach out to one of the CORE leaders
* What we expect - at least one publication every months to maintain your writer status
  * If missed for three months, the writer status will be revoked
