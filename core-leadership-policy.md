# CORE Leadership Policy
* Being a CORE leader is not just a title, it carries certain responsibilities that leaders will be accountable to deliver
  * ORGANIZING activities (not just participation or volunteering activities)
  * Organizing events (know how to use meetup; know how to use restream; know the community structure and social media channels)
  * Speaking/Moderation of community events 

* The CORE leadership operates a four month rotational leadership style where each core leader has the opportunity to take on the strategic leadership for the community. The reason for this is to ensure that every core leader understands what it takes to lead the community and we are not dependent on a single person but also to ensure that new thoughts and ideas can be infused into the community.

* What we expect from the current leader
  * Define the goals for the next four months of your leadership and communicate with the CORE leadership
  * Once the direction is agreed, communicate the goals to all leadership units and the AWS community team
  * Strategic and operational coordination of defined community activities
  * Write at least one monthly report on what has been achieved recently. The report needs to be communicated to the community leadership group, AWS Community team and AWS Slack.
